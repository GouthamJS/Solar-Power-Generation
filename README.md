# ☀️ Solar Power Generation – Regression Project

## 🔍 Project Overview
Accurately forecasting solar power generation is essential for efficient energy management and planning. This project focuses on building a regression model that predicts solar energy production based on various environmental and atmospheric conditions. The insights can be used to optimize resource allocation and energy distribution in renewable energy grids.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the impact of weather and atmospheric conditions on solar energy output
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand variable relationships
- Train and evaluate multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Deploy the final model using Streamlit for interactive usage
- Identify key environmental drivers influencing solar energy production
